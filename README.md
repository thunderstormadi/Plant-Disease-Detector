# Plant Disease Detector 🌱

A machine learning-powered application for detecting and classifying plant diseases from leaf images. This project aims to help farmers and gardeners identify plant diseases early, enabling timely treatment and reducing crop losses.

## 🚀 Features

- *Real-time Disease Detection*: Upload plant leaf images and get instant disease predictions
- *Multi-Plant Support*: Detects diseases across various plant species including tomato, potato, pepper, and more
- *High Accuracy*: Uses deep learning models trained on extensive plant disease datasets
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Clean and intuitive web interface for easy interaction
- *Confidence Scoring*: Provides prediction confidence levels for better decision-making
- *Treatment Recommendations*: Suggests appropriate treatments for detected diseases
- *Mobile Responsive*: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Machine Learning*: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch
- *Backend*: Python, Flask/Django
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- *Image Processing*: OpenCV, PIL
- *Data Processing*: NumPy, Pandas
- *Visualization*: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset), which contains:
- 50,000+ images of healthy and diseased plant leaves
- 14 crop species
- 26 disease classes
- High-resolution images for accurate classification
